Download the compressed data files under the v1 release. Place all files in a folder titled "pickled_data" inside the repository. 

Use analysis files titled "average_across_participant_steering_data.ipynb" to look at steering data, and "batch_process_gaze_data.ipynb" to look at gaze data for all participants.

The file process_data_1.py includes the functions used to generate the compressed pickle files and is referenced inside each analysis notebook.
