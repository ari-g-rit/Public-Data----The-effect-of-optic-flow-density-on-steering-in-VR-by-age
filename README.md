Note: 
The python file "process_data_1.py" is the most important file in this repo. It organizes the functions by trial and by participant to accommodate detailed analysis within or across participants.

To use this analysis code and visualize data:
1. Download the compressed data files under the v1 release. Place all files in a folder titled "pickled_data" inside the repository. 
2. Use analysis files titled "average_across_participant_steering_data.ipynb" to look at steering data, and "batch_process_gaze_data.ipynb" to look at gaze data for all participants.
3. The file process_data_1.py includes the functions used to generate the compressed pickle files and is referenced inside each analysis notebook.
